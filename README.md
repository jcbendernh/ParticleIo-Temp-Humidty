# ParticleIo-Temp-Humidty
This is the arduino code to be used with a Particle IO SI7020-A20 temperature/ humidty sensor.

The SI7020_A20.ino arduino file at https://github.com/ControlEverythingCommunity/SI7020-A20 was used as a template for this with some modifications to include humidty and pieces of code taken from others.

I am using this with my Particle Electron and Photon devices.
