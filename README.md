# ParticleIo-Temp-Humidty
This is the arduino code to be used with a Particle IO SI7020-A20 temperature/ humidty sensor.

The SI7020_A20.ino arduino file at https://github.com/ControlEverythingCommunity/SI7020-A20 was used as a template for this with some modifications to include humidity and pieces of code taken from others.  

I am using this with my Particle Electron and Photon devices. 

Code Update June 16, 2017 - Incorporates code modifications by Chet Kloss to streamline the logic and I also added lines fo Celsius readings.  These lines are rem'd out.  To enable these, just swap them with the Fareheit code.
